# 3-column-preview-card

## Description
This is my first completed project for Frontend Mentor. You can see the original assignment and specs [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-/hub/3column-preview-card-component--BQcTUVFz).

The content of this project is a three-column component featuring vehicles, with each column featuring an image, text and a button. This component can easily be repurposed for other uses and the colors can easily be updated by replacing the SASS variables for each color.

For this project I chose to get back to basics and create the content using only HTML and not React or using a framework like BootStrap. The content is styled using SASS and Flexbox. This is my first time using SASS, though I have used SCSS before. The new syntax, namely not using curly brackets to wrap my rules, was often frustrating but very workable.
